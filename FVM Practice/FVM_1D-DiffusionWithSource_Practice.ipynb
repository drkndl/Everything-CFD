    "We discuss the cooling of a circular fin by means of convective heat transfer along its length. Convection gives rise to a temperature-dependent heat loss or sink term in the governing equation. There is a cylindrical fin with uniform cross-sectional area A. The base is at a temperature of 100°C ($T_B$) and the end is insulated. The fin is exposed to an ambient temperature of 20°C. One dimensional heat transfer in this situation is governed by:\n",
